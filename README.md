 Text simplification is one of the domains in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that offers an opportunity to understand the text in a simplified manner for exploration. However, it is always hard to understand and retrieve knowledge from unstructured text, which is usually in the form of compound and complex sentences. There are state-of-the-art neural network-based methods to simplify the sentences for improved readability while replacing words with plain English substitutes and summarising the sentences and paragraphs. In the Knowledge Graph (KG) creation process from unstructured text, summarising long sentences and substituting words is undesirable since this may lead to information loss. In this work, we propose a controlled simplification approach based on OpenAI, which transform a compound and complex sentence into a simple set of sentence. This simplification process retains the original wording and involves syntactic rewriting of the sentence. The paper also introduces an algorithm to identify and measure a sentenceâ€™s syntactic complexity (SC), followed by reduction through a controlled syntactic simplification process.
